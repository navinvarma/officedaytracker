  - Tests the complete flow: open date picker → select date → confirm → log office day
  - Validates that `Calendar.createEventAsync` is called with proper parameters

- **Test**: `should handle past date logging correctly`
  - Ensures that past dates can be logged as office days
  - Tests the date picker functionality for historical dates
  - Validates event creation for non-current dates

### 2. Past Events Retrieval ✅
- **Test**: `should display past office days correctly`
  - Verifies that the Past Office Days modal displays correctly
  - Tests the menu navigation: ☰ → 📅 Past Office Days
  - Validates that multiple office day events are shown in the list

- **Test**: `should show correct event dates in past events list`
  - Ensures that specific event dates are displayed correctly
  - Tests the date formatting and display logic
  - Validates the event list rendering

### 3. Calendar Highlighting ✅
- **Test**: `should highlight office day dates in calendar with correct color`
  - Verifies that office day dates are visually highlighted in the calendar widget
  - Tests the calendar navigation and month display
  - Validates the visual indicators for logged office days

- **Test**: `should show different colors for today vs office days`
  - Ensures that today's date and office day dates have distinct visual styling
  - Tests the calendar color coding system
  - Validates the different highlight states

### 4. Date Validation ✅
- **Test**: `should prevent logging future dates`
  - Verifies that the app prevents logging office days for future dates
  - Tests the month navigation restrictions
  - Validates the future date prevention logic

- **Test**: `should allow logging dates from the past 6 months`
  - Ensures that dates from the past 6 months can be selected
  - Tests the backward month navigation
  - Validates the historical date range functionality

### 5. Data Consistency ✅
- **Test**: `should refresh calendar data after logging new office day`
  - Verifies that the calendar data is refreshed after logging a new office day
  - Tests the data synchronization between logging and display
  - Validates that `Calendar.getEventsAsync` is called to refresh data

- **Test**: `should update month statistics after logging office day`
  - Ensures that month statistics are recalculated after logging
  - Tests the real-time data updates
  - Validates the statistics calculation logic

## 🔧 Test Infrastructure

### Jest Configuration
- **Preset**: `jest-expo` for Expo SDK 53 compatibility
- **Environment**: Node.js test environment
- **Coverage Threshold**: 70% (currently at 67% - close to target)

### Mocking Strategy
- **expo-calendar**: Fully mocked with Jest functions
- **React Native Components**: Mocked via jest-expo preset
- **Alert System**: Mocked to prevent test interruptions
- **Date/Time**: Consistent mock dates for reproducible tests

### Test Utilities
- **@testing-library/react-native**: For component rendering and interaction
- **waitFor**: For asynchronous operations and state changes
- **fireEvent**: For simulating user interactions
- **Mock Functions**: For testing API calls and side effects

## 🎯 Key Testing Patterns

### 1. User Interaction Flow
```typescript
// Open date picker
const dateButton = getByTestId('date-picker-button');
fireEvent.press(dateButton);

// Wait for modal to open
await waitFor(() => {
    expect(getByText('Select Date')).toBeTruthy();
});

// Interact with calendar
const day15 = getByText('15');
fireEvent.press(day15);
```

### 2. API Mocking
```typescript
// Mock successful event creation
(Calendar.createEventAsync as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue('new-event-id');

// Verify API was called correctly
await waitFor(() => {
    expect(Calendar.createEventAsync).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        'test-calendar-id',
        expect.objectContaining({
            title: 'Office Day',
            startDate: expect.any(Date),
            endDate: expect.any(Date),
            allDay: true
        })
    );
});
```

### 3. State Validation
```typescript
// Verify UI reflects the expected state
await waitFor(() => {
    expect(getByText('Past Office Days')).toBeTruthy();
    const officeDayElements = getAllByText('Office Day');
    expect(officeDayElements.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

## 🚀 Test Execution

### Available Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:ci       # Run tests for CI/CD pipeline
```

### Test Performance
- **Average Test Time**: ~100-200ms per test
- **Total Suite Time**: ~4 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with proper cleanup
